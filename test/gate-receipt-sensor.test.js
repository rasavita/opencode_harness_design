/**
 * Skipped-gate sensor (R7, detect-not-block).
 *
 * The audited run left no `brd-approval.json` and no `design-approval.json`.
 * The gates were prose the agent could omit, and — the part that mattered —
 * **nobody could tell afterwards**. Two of three planning gates simply did not
 * happen and the run looked normal.
 *
 * Enforcing them in a hook is not available: hooks fire on tool calls, and
 * there is no phase-transition event to gate. `phaseRan` also tests directory
 * existence rather than authorship, so in any repo that has run /build once,
 * every later /feature, /change, /vibe and /refactor would be blocked for not
 * producing artifacts they were never meant to produce.
 *
 * So this detects and reports. It never blocks. Making "silently didn't run"
 * measurable is the property that was missing; blocking is not.
