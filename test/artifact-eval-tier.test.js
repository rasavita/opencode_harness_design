// Artifact-mode evaluation runs on the sidekick tier, and its result does not

// Runtime mode — driving a live app and judging whether a feature works — keeps
// the frontier pin. Artifact mode scores planning documents whose load-bearing
// properties were ALREADY proven deterministically (grounding gates, taxonomy
// floor, trace-check, cluster gates); what the rubric adds is prose-level
// consistency. On a metered run that layer helped drive a $118.60 front half in
// which only $12.00 was generated output, and one result file was 47 KB read
// straight back into the shaping session.
