// Skipped-gate sensor (R7, detect-not-block).
//
// The audited run left no brd-approval.json and no design-approval.json: two of
// three planning gates did not happen, and the run looked entirely normal. The
// missing property was not enforcement — it was VISIBILITY. Nobody could tell
// afterwards.
//
// Why this is a sensor and not a gate. Hooks fire on tool calls, and there is no
// phase-transition event to gate, so "do not proceed past Phase N" has no hook
// counterpart. And plan-approval's phaseRan tests directory existence, not
// authorship: in any repo that has run /build once, specs/brd|stories|design are
// populated forever after, so a hook keyed on that would block every later
// /feature, /change, /vibe and /refactor — lanes that reach /auto writing no BRD
// at all. Detecting is available and honest; blocking is not.
//
// Pure: the caller injects phaseRan/readReceipt, so the rules are testable
// without a filesystem.

// Which lanes own which planning gates. Explicit rather than derived, so adding
// a lane is a decision someone makes rather than a side effect.
//
// These are the values record-run.js actually writes to .opencode/state/current-lane
// — parseBuildInvocation().lane from build-lane.js, NOT the command name. An
// earlier version keyed on "build", which record-run never writes, so the sensor
// was inert for every real /build run: the exact incident it exists to detect.
//
// A headless lane still expects receipts. `--auto` and `--autonomous` skip the
// human loops but /build's collapsed-lane step waives each phase explicitly, so
// an absent receipt there means even the waiver did not happen — which is the
// same silence, and a waiver is not treated as a finding.
