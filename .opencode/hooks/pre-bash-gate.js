// PreToolUse(Bash) — closes the shell write-bypass.
// The Write/Edit/MultiEdit pre-write gate cannot see files created through the
// shell (redirections, tee, sed -i, dd, cp/mv), so an agent could disable a
// quality gate, escape the project tree, or clobber a .env entirely outside the
// gate. This hook extracts the command's write targets and re-applies the
// security-critical subset of the pre-write checks: project scope, the harness
// machinery trust-boundary, and protected env files. Content-level checks
// (secrets, length, TDD) cannot be reproduced from a shell string and remain the
// Write path's responsibility — agents should prefer Write/Edit for source so
// those checks apply. Escape hatches: HARNESS_PROTECT=off (machinery only);
// HARNESS_PREFIX_EDIT=1 (prompt-cache prefix files only).
