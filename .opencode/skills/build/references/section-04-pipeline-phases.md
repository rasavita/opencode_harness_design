## Pipeline Phases (0–11)

> **Numbering note.** The phases run **0 → 11**, with three half-step inserts (3.5 plan gate, 4.5 deploy, 9.5 pre-PR verify) for steps that only apply in some modes. The autonomous *execution* is a **single `/auto` call** — the "Phases 5–8" heading below is one step, not four; the sub-numbers are historical and kept only so cross-references stay stable. When in doubt, the canonical list is the tail diagram in `references/autonomous-lane.md`.

> **Resumability.** `/build` is re-entrant. Each planning phase (0–3) is **skip-if-its-artifacts-exist**: if `specs/brd/`, `specs/stories/`, or `specs/design/` are already populated from an interrupted run, do not regenerate them — confirm they are complete and move on (re-running a phase silently discards human-approved plan edits). Phase 4 state files follow the per-file reset-vs-preserve rule documented there. Only force a regenerate when the user explicitly asks to redo a phase.

**Boundary with `/sprint`.** If `specs/design/architecture.md` already
exists, this project has already been through sprint 1 (or a recovered
baseline) — `/build` is not the right entry point for further work. Stop and
tell the human to run `/sprint <prd-file>` instead, which grounds the new PRD
against the prior sprint and amends the living design rather than
regenerating it. Only continue past this check when `specs/design/` does not
yet have an approved baseline.

### Phase 0 — Brownfield Discovery [EXISTING CODEBASES]

**Boundary with `/feature`.** `/build` is the **greenfield** pipeline. For *changing existing-code behavior* — adding or altering a feature in a live codebase — use **`/feature`**, the brownfield change route (it owns the DeepWiki lifecycle, Linear tracking, and the single-story-vs-epic routing). Reach Phase 0 here only when you are running a **full greenfield-style build that happens to be layered onto an existing repo** (e.g. standing up a new service inside a monorepo) and you need the discovery maps as planning constraints. If the request is really an existing-code change, stop and route to `/feature`.

If this is a non-trivial existing codebase and `specs/brownfield/codebase-map.md` does not exist, run `/brownfield` before Phase 1. Use the generated architecture, test, risk, and change-strategy maps as constraints for the BRD, stories, and design.

Skip Phase 0 only for greenfield projects, documentation-only work, or tiny `/vibe`-eligible changes.

### Phase 1 — Business Requirements [HUMAN APPROVAL]

Run `/brd` with the provided requirements document. Outputs are written to `specs/brd/`.

**Stop and wait for explicit human approval before proceeding.** Present a summary of the BRD and ask: "Approve BRD to proceed to Phase 2?"

Record the outcome with `node .opencode/scripts/plan-approval.js record --phase brd --in-session` so the stop is verifiable rather than prose — Phase 3 checks `--phase all`, which now includes it. Do NOT proceed without a clear "yes" or "approved" from the user. *(In `--autonomous` mode, do not stop here — the BRD is approved together with everything else at the consolidated Plan Approval gate, Phase 3.5.)*

**Why `--in-session` here and nowhere else.** Every approving round normally prints a handoff telling the human to `/clear` before the next phase — that clear is where most of the front half's cost savings live, because a phase's artifacts otherwise stay resident and get re-billed on every turn of the next phase. This conductor runs all phases from one session and cannot clear itself mid-run, so it suppresses the handoff rather than printing an instruction the human cannot follow. That is a real cost `/build` pays for its continuity: **running `/brd` → `/spec` → `/design` → `/test` as separate invocations, clearing between each, is the cheaper interactive route.** Prefer it when a human is present anyway; `--autonomous` chaining already gets fresh contexts via `build-chain.js`.

### Phase 2 — Story Specification [HUMAN APPROVAL]

Run `/spec` using the approved BRD. Outputs are written to `specs/stories/` and root `features.json`.

**Pass `--in-session` to `/spec`'s decisions gate** (`validate-spec-decisions.js --in-session`, Step 5). That gate now prints a checkpoint telling the human to `/clear` and re-enter with `/spec --render-only` before the render stretch — the same instruction this conductor cannot follow, for the same reason as `--in-session` on the approval rounds above. Without the flag, `/spec` Step 6's `handoff-check --stage render` blocks this lane. It is the same trade recorded below: the separate-invocation route is cheaper, and this is another place `/build` pays for continuity.

**Stop and run `/spec`'s Step 8 review loop before proceeding** — a `plan-review-loop` dialogue over the decomposition, not a single approve/reject question. It ends by recording `plan-approval.js record --phase spec --in-session`, which Phase 3 hard-blocks on.

Do NOT proceed without an approving round on the receipt. *(In `--autonomous` mode, do not stop here — deferred to the consolidated Plan Approval gate, Phase 3.5.)*

If the user already has product stories, `/spec` may normalize those existing stories instead of deriving them from the BRD. The output contract is still the same: `epics.md`, ready story files, `dependency-graph.md`, and root `features.json`. Stories marked `needs_breakdown` must be resolved before Phase 3.

### Phase 3 — Architecture Design + Test Planning [HUMAN APPROVAL]

**Pass `--in-session` to `/design`'s decisions gate too** (`validate-design-decisions.js --in-session`, Step 0.9 §2) — same reason as `/spec`'s above: that gate now prints a checkpoint asking the human to `/clear` and re-enter with `/design --render-only`, which this conductor cannot do. Without the flag, §3's `handoff-check --stage render` blocks this lane.

Run `/design` and `/test --plan-only` **in parallel** using two concurrent Agent calls. Both consume `/spec` output independently:

- **`/design`** — produces architecture artifacts in `specs/design/` (architecture, api-contracts, component-map, data-models, schemas).
- **`/test --plan-only`** — produces test plan, test cases mapped to acceptance criteria, and test data fixtures in `specs/test_artefacts/` (test-plan.md, test-cases.md, test-data/).

Wait for BOTH to complete before presenting results.

**Then compute plan confidence.** Run `node .opencode/scripts/plan-confidence.js`, which writes `specs/plan-confidence.json` — a band (high/medium/low), a score, and its risk drivers, derived deterministically from the BRD's open questions and assumptions, the needs-breakdown backlog, the epic count, hollow definitions in the design schemas, and unmitigated high/critical seams in the brownfield risk map. This gates **planning only** and never touches the machine verification gates; it just makes the planner's own uncertainty visible to the gate that follows.

**Stop and run both review loops before proceeding — in this session, not in the sub-skills.** `/design` and `/test --plan-only` are dispatched as forked agents, and a forked skill cannot pause for `AskUserQuestion`; a review loop delegated into one of them can only ask itself. **`/build` runs both `plan-review-loop` dialogues itself** (`--phase design`, `--phase test`) after the two agents return, reading the artifacts they wrote. They review different decisions and are not collapsed into one question. Run them in sequence, design first, since the test plan's obligations follow from the approved schemas. Each brief carries:

1. Architecture summary: tech stack, component count, API surface area.
2. Test plan summary: test case count, story coverage, fixture count — and what was deliberately left untested.
3. **Plan confidence** from `specs/plan-confidence.json`: the band and its drivers — present it here too, not only in the `--autonomous` Phase 3.5 gate, so the human reviews with the planner's uncertainty in view.

**Enforce the confidence gate here, not only in `--auto`.** *(Gated lane only. In `--auto` / `--autonomous` the gate runs once at Phase 3.5 with its own single-`/clarify` retry — running it here as well would invoke `/clarify` twice for the same drivers.)* Run:

```bash
node .opencode/scripts/plan-confidence.js . --gate
```

Exit 2 (band LOW) **blocks**. The gated lane gets the same treatment `--auto` already has: run `/clarify` on the drivers, recompute, retry once. If it is still LOW, present the drivers and let the human decide explicitly — approving a LOW plan is a decision they may take, but it has to be taken, not defaulted into. A real run recorded `score: 0, band: low, hardLow: true` and proceeded to `/design` fifteen hours later, because nothing in this lane ever read it.

**Before quoting `specs/plan-confidence.json` in any brief, check it still describes the current plan:**

```bash
node .opencode/scripts/plan-confidence.js . --verify
```

Exit 1 means stale — the verdict was computed from planning files that have since changed. That same run's artifact still claimed 7 undecomposable stories after the review round had brought it to 6. A stale verdict is worse than none, because it reads as current: recompute rather than quoting it.

**When confidence is LOW, lead with the drivers and recommend `/clarify` first** — e.g. *"Plan confidence is LOW (2 open questions, 1 undecomposable story). Recommend `/clarify` before building. Clarify now, review anyway, or stop?"* (This mirrors what `--auto` does automatically; in the gated model the human makes the call.)

Do NOT proceed until `node .opencode/scripts/plan-approval.js check --phase all` exits 0. *(In `--autonomous` mode, do not present a design-only gate here — go to Phase 3.5, which presents the whole plan at once.)*

### Phase 3.5 — Consolidated Plan Approval [`--autonomous` ONLY]

**Skipped entirely in `--auto` (full-auto).** In full-auto there is no human approval gate — Phases 1–3 produce the plan and the pipeline proceeds straight to Phase 4. (In `--auto` you may still print the plan summary below for the log, but do **not** stop for approval.)

**Confidence gate in `--auto` — the one exception to "zero gates".** After Phase 3 writes `specs/plan-confidence.json`, enforce it **mechanically** as well as in prose:

1. Run `node .opencode/scripts/plan-confidence.js .` (writes the artifact) then `node .opencode/scripts/plan-confidence.js . --gate`.
2. Exit code **0** (band high|medium) → proceed to Phase 4 with no stop.
3. Exit code **2** (band **low**) → auto-invoke `/clarify` **once** (local context + recorded assumptions; headless). Recompute: `node .opencode/scripts/plan-confidence.js .` then `node .opencode/scripts/plan-confidence.js . --gate` again.
4. If the second `--gate` is still **2**, **stop** and surface `specs/plan-confidence.json` drivers — do not start `/auto` / Phase 4. Never loop `/clarify` more than once; a plan that stays under-determined after one pass is a human decision, not a retry.

(The same bar as a missing PRD: unattended mode must not invent a sure plan.)

In `--autonomous` mode this is the **single** human gate. After Phases 1–3 have produced the BRD, stories, design, and test plan **without stopping**, present them together in one summary:
1. BRD: problem, scope (in/out), **Forbidden Actions**, success metrics.
2. Stories: count, dependency groups, the Mermaid dependency graph.
3. Design: tech stack, component count, API surface, data model.
4. Test plan: case count, story coverage, fixture count.
5. Deliverable shape detected from `project-manifest.json` (has API? has UI?) and the verification mode — so the human knows which pre-PR checks (Phase 9.5) will run.
6. **Plan confidence** from `specs/plan-confidence.json`: the band (high/medium/low) and its drivers — so the human approves with the planner's own uncertainty in view, not blind.
7. **Projected spend** vs the budget cap: a rough estimate from the story/group count (`~N min · ~M agents · ~$K`, same rate table as `budget-state.js`) against the resolved cap — so the human sees the likely cost before approving. In `--auto`, if the projection already exceeds the cap before a single group runs, stop and surface it rather than starting a run that cannot finish in budget.

Ask once: **"Approve this plan to build autonomously through to an open PR?"** On a clear "yes/approved", proceed through Phases 4–11 with **no further human stops** — the machine gates carry the rest. On anything else, fall back to the gated model (treat the remaining phases as gated). In the default (non-`--autonomous`) model, skip Phase 3.5 entirely; the per-phase gates above already ran.

**Satisfy `/auto`'s review gate for the collapsed lanes.** `/auto` blocks on `plan-approval.js check --phase all`, so a lane that skipped the per-phase loops records *why* rather than leaving the receipt absent — an absent receipt and a deliberately-headless run are different facts, and the audit trail should say which one this was:

```bash
for phase in brd spec design test; do
  node .opencode/scripts/plan-approval.js waive --phase "$phase" --lane --autonomous   # or --lane --auto
done
```

Write the `--autonomous` waivers only **after** the consolidated approval above is given; on a fallback to the gated model, do not write them — the per-phase loops run instead. In `--auto`, write the `--auto` waivers once Phase 3 completes.

When confidence is **low**, do not present the bare approve/reject question — lead with the drivers and recommend resolving them first, e.g. *"Plan confidence is LOW (2 open questions, 1 undecomposable story). Recommend `/clarify` before an unattended run. Clarify now, approve anyway, or stop?"* High/medium confidence keeps the single question above.

### Phase 4 — Initialize State

Create the following state files before entering the autonomous loop. **Re-entry rule:** `/build` is resumable — if a state file already exists (a prior run was interrupted), follow the per-file reset-vs-preserve note below rather than blindly clobbering it. Only `budget-start` resets on every fresh run; the accumulated ratchet state must survive a re-run.

1. `.opencode/state/coverage-baseline.txt` — **Preserve if present.** Write `0` only when the file does not yet exist; if it already holds a value (a prior run ratcheted it up), leave it — resetting it to `0` would discard the coverage floor the ratchet has earned.
2. `.opencode/state/iteration-log.md` — **Preserve if present.** Write the header `# Iteration Log\n\nTracking all autonomous build iterations.\n` only when the file does not exist; otherwise append, never overwrite — the log is the audit trail across sessions.
2b. `.opencode/state/budget-start` — **Always reset.** Write the current epoch-ms with `node -e 'process.stdout.write(String(Date.now()))' > .opencode/state/budget-start` (portable; do **not** use `date +%s%3N`, which is GNU-only and on macOS/BSD writes a malformed `…N`-suffixed value). Stamps the run origin for budget metering (SECTION 11 of `auto/SKILL.md`); overwrite on each fresh `/build` so a new run resets the clock.
3. `harness-progress.txt` — Write session 0 block:
   ```
   === Session 0 ===
   date: {ISO 8601 now}
   mode: {mode}
   groups_completed: []
   groups_remaining: [all group IDs from dependency-graph.md]
   current_group: none
   features_passing: 0 / {total features}
   coverage: 0%
   learned_rules: 0
   next_action: Begin autonomous build with /auto
   ```

### Phase 4.5 — Generate Deployment Artifacts [DOCKER MODE]

If `project-manifest.json` has `verification.mode: "docker"` (the default for full-stack projects), run `/deploy` now — before `/auto`. It generates the Docker Compose stack, Dockerfiles, `.env.example`, and **`init.sh`**, which `/auto`'s Gate 5 (docker startup) requires to bring the app up for evaluation. Skipping this in docker mode leaves `/auto` unable to start the stack.

Skip Phase 4.5 for `local` or `stub` verification modes — those reach the app without Docker, so no deploy artifacts are needed yet.

### Phases 5-8 — Autonomous Execution

Run `/auto --mode {mode}` to enter the autonomous build loop. If the resolved lane has `singlePr: true` (i.e. the user passed `--single-pr`), forward it: run `/auto --mode {mode} --single-pr`. The `/auto` skill handles all remaining execution: sprint contracts, agent teams, ratchet gates, self-healing, and session chaining.

**Pod mode (`--pod N`).** Pass `--pod N` through to `/auto` to run the **multi-engineer pod**: each independent cluster (dependency group) is built by its own engineer-orchestrator, verified per-cluster (the Phase 9.5 ladder, scoped to the cluster), and raised as its own draft PR (stacked on its predecessor's branch when the cluster is dependent) via `wave-pr.js` — one per cluster, opened immediately. Dependent clusters open **stacked** draft PRs whose base is the predecessor's branch (`auto/group-{predecessor}`) — there is no merge wait; the next wave starts right away. Humans merge the stack bottom-up (GitHub auto-retargets each child PR to `main` as its parent merges); `AUTO_MERGE` auto-merges per PR when checks pass. In pod mode the per-cluster PRs ARE the deliverable, so Phase 9.5 and Phase 11 below run **inside** `/auto` per cluster rather than once over the whole app — see `.opencode/skills/auto/SKILL.md` Section 4B → *Pod mode*. Without `--pod`, the pipeline produces a single integrated PR (Phases 9.5 + 11 below). **With `--pod N --single-pr`**, you get pod concurrency (up to N parallel cluster builds) but ONE integrated PR at the end — `--single-pr` overrides the per-cluster PR default regardless of cluster count. Pass both flags through: `/auto --mode {mode} --pod N --single-pr`.

**Parallel agent teams:** the full SDLC pipeline runs each dependency group through `/auto`, which parallelizes on two axes:
- **Within-group:** one teammate per story for any group with **≥ 2 stories** — see `.opencode/agents/generator.md` Rule 2.
- **Cross-group:** up to 3 independent dependency groups run concurrently as group-orchestrator subagents (configurable via `--parallel-groups N`; opt out with `--sequential`) — see Section 4B of `.opencode/skills/auto/SKILL.md`.

For a multi-group project with multi-story groups, peak parallelism is 3 groups × 5 teammates = 15 concurrent subagents. Cross-group parallelism uses per-group git branches (`auto/group-B`, `auto/group-C`) merged sequentially after each wave to avoid trunk commit conflicts.

### Phase 9 — E2E Test Generation

After `/auto` completes (all groups done or stopping criteria met), run `/test --e2e-only` to generate Playwright E2E tests against the built source code. This uses the test plan and cases from Phase 3 as input.

The generator generates one Playwright spec per story (`e2e/{story-id}.spec.ts`), copies the Playwright config template, installs Playwright, and runs the full E2E suite. All tests must pass.

If E2E tests fail, fix them before proceeding. The tests are the specification — if a test fails because the implementation is wrong, fix the implementation, not the test.

### Phase 9.5 — Pre-PR Verification & Defect Repair

The final acceptance run on the **integrated** build, against a **locally deployed** app — the Devin-style "deploy, test, fix defects" gate that must pass before any PR. It is **shape-aware**: read `project-manifest.json` to detect whether the deliverable has an API, a UI, or both, then run only the relevant checks **in this order**:

1. **Deploy locally.** Bring the whole app up the way it actually runs — honor `verification.mode`: `docker` → `bash init.sh` (compose up + health checks); `local` → the manifest's start command (e.g. `npm start`); `stub` → the in-process harness. Confirm health before testing.
2. **API tests (if the deliverable exposes an API).** Run the API/integration suite against the running app, asserting the `api-contracts` (status codes, schemas, auth). API tests run **first** — a broken API makes UI failures noise.
3. **Playwright E2E (if the deliverable has a UI).** If the deliverable has a UI, first run `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` — idempotent, and chained sessions can span long enough for browser binaries to be missing. Only after the API is green, run the Phase 9 Playwright suite against the deployed UI.
4. **Defect-repair loop (bounded).** On any failure, capture the concrete diagnostics (failing assertion, response body, browser console errors, service logs), fix the **implementation** (not the test), redeploy, and re-run from step 2. Cap at a small number of attempts; if still failing, stop and surface the diagnostics rather than raising a PR. The evaluator agent is the oracle — the generator never declares this green itself.

   **On give-up, write a structured failure report** to `specs/verification/failure-report.md` before stopping: which suite failed, the final failing assertion(s), the captured diagnostics, the attempt count, and the last implementation diff tried. In `--auto`/`--autonomous` mode no human is watching the loop live, so this artifact is the only durable record of *why* the run halted — without it the failure is invisible until someone re-derives it. A human (or a later resumed run) reads this report instead of re-running the loop from scratch.

Only when the applicable suites are all green does the pipeline proceed. Full loop detail: `.opencode/skills/build/references/autonomous-lane.md`.

### Phase 9.9 — Write the milestone log [when a milestone plan exists]

If `specs/brd/brd-milestones.json` is non-empty, copy
`.opencode/templates/milestone-log.template.md` to
`specs/milestones/<milestone-id>-log.md` for the milestone just built, and fill
it in. Skip only when the project has no milestone plan at all.

This is the cross-session link. The next milestone's `/spec` reads these logs to
know what actually exists, rather than re-deriving the state of the system from
the PRD — a document that describes what was *intended*. Two sections carry the
weight:

- **Decisions taken that the PRD did not specify.** Each is a constraint the
  next milestone inherits. An implementer who does not know about it will
  contradict it, and nothing downstream will notice.
- **Deviations from the PRD, and why.** The one people skip. An unrecorded
  deviation is a silent divergence between the document the pipeline grounds
  against and the system that exists — after which every traceability gate is
  faithfully proving something about the wrong thing. Write "none" explicitly
  rather than deleting the section; an absent section and no deviations are
  different facts.

Write it from evidence — the sprint contract results, the E2E verdict, the
grounding verdicts — not from memory of the run.

### Phase 10 — Generate README.md

After E2E tests pass, generate a `README.md` for the built application. This is the developer-facing guide for running, understanding, and contributing to the generated project.

Read the following to build the README:
- `specs/brd/brd.md` — what the app does (project description)
- `specs/design/architecture.md` — system architecture
- `specs/design/api-contracts.md` or `api-contracts.schema.json` — API surface
- `specs/design/component-map.md` — module structure
- `project-manifest.json` — tech stack, verification mode
- `init.sh` — setup steps
- `docker-compose.yml` (if exists) — services
- `.env.example` (if exists) — required environment variables

**README must include these sections:**

```markdown
# {Project Name}

{1-2 sentence description from BRD}

## Architecture

{System diagram: layers, services, data flow. Use ASCII art or bullet list.
Show: frontend -> API -> service -> repository -> database.
Note external APIs if any.}

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Backend | {from manifest} |
| Frontend | {from manifest} |
| Database | {from manifest} |
| Testing | {from manifest} |

## Prerequisites

- {language version}
- Docker + Docker Compose
- {any external API keys needed — reference .env.example}

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter
git clone <repo-url> && cd {project-name}

# 2. Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# 3. Start everything
bash init.sh
# OR: docker compose up -d

# 4. Verify
curl http://localhost:{port}/health
```

## API Endpoints

{Table of all endpoints from api-contracts: method, path, description, auth required}

## Project Structure

```
{Directory tree showing key files and their responsibilities.
 Use component-map.md as source. Show backend/, frontend/, tests/}
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && uv run pytest --cov=src -v

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm test
```

## Environment Variables

{Table from .env.example: variable name, description, required/optional, example value}

## Development

{Brief notes on: how to add a new endpoint, how to run linters,
 how to run the app locally without Docker}
```

**Rules:**
- README describes the GENERATED APP, not the harness. Do not mention Claude, the harness, `/auto`, or agents.
- All commands must be tested — run them mentally against the generated code to verify they work.
- API endpoint table must match the actual routes in the code, not just the spec.
- Environment variables table must match `.env.example` exactly.

Commit the README: `git add README.md && git commit -m "docs: add README with architecture, setup, and API reference"`

### Phase 11 — Raise PR [gated on all-green]

The pipeline's terminal step. **Only reachable when Phase 9.5 passed** (applicable API + E2E suites green) and `/gate` (evaluator + adaptive review + quality-card) is clean — never raise a PR over a failing or unverified build.

1. Run `/gate` if it has not already run on the final integrated state; abort the PR on any block-level finding. `/gate` Step 4 must have written `specs/reviews/quality-card.md` + `walkthrough.md` (and stamped `.opencode/state/gate-receipt.json`).
2. Compose the PR body from the gate receipts (do **not** hand-roll a thin summary):
   ```bash
   node .opencode/scripts/pr-body.js --require-gate --title "<stories delivered>" > /tmp/pr-body.md
   # exit 1 if quality-card is FAIL/incomplete — abort PR open
   gh pr create --title "..." --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
   ```
   The body includes the quality card, logical walkthrough, and navigation links (`docs/CODEBASE.md`, DeepWiki, `npm run ask`). Append Phase 9.5 proof and the PRD link under the generated body or via `--extra`. Pod mode: pass the same body into `wave-pr.js --body "$(node .opencode/scripts/pr-body.js --require-gate)"`.
3. **Merge.** Raising the PR is the autonomous boundary, and merge stays human
   **unless** AUTO_MERGE is active — the `--auto-merge` flag or `AUTO_MERGE=true`
   env (method from `MERGE_METHOD`, default `merge`). When active, run
   `node .opencode/scripts/auto-merge.js <prUrl> --auto-merge`: it pins the PR to
   the current repo (`git remote get-url origin`) and runs `gh pr merge --auto
   --<method>`, so **GitHub merges only once the repo's required status checks
   pass** — never a red build. If auto-merge can't be enabled (the repo lacks
   "Allow auto-merge", a `gh` error, or a repo-slug mismatch), it leaves the PR
   open and surfaces the reason; the run never fails over auto-merge. **Caveat:**
   on a repo with no required status checks, `gh pr merge --auto` merges
   immediately, so AUTO_MERGE there merges right after the harness gates — assume
   "Allow auto-merge" + branch protection with required checks.

4. **Respond pass (opt-in).** If `--respond` was passed (default off), invoke `/pr-respond <pr#> --watch` on each PR just opened, so red CI or early review comments get one bounded response pass before handoff. Merge remains human-owned regardless.

In the **gated** model, offer to raise the PR rather than doing it unprompted. In **`--autonomous`** mode, raise it automatically once green — that is the point of the run. **In `--pod` mode this phase is superseded:** the per-cluster PRs were already raised by the engineer-orchestrators inside `/auto` (Section 4B → Pod mode), so there is no single integrated PR to open here — instead, confirm every cluster's PR is open and green and report the set. Detail: `.opencode/skills/build/references/autonomous-lane.md`.
