# Brownfield Discovery

Use `/brownfield` in existing repositories before substantial planning, improvements, refactors, or bug work. The goal is to build a factual map of the current system so agents respect the codebase instead of inventing a parallel architecture.

This skill does not change production code.

> **Ultracode tip:** Mapping an unknown codebase is the canonical fan-out task, so run `/effort ultracode` *before* this phase — broad parallel coverage plus adversarial verification produces better maps. Drop back to `/effort high` before the execution phases (`/auto`, `/implement`).

---

## Usage

```text
/brownfield
/brownfield backend/src
/brownfield "map auth and billing before adding team invites"
/brownfield --for "add team invites"          # lean maps scoped to a change goal
/brownfield --seams "add team invites"        # map, then rank the safest cut-points for this goal
/brownfield --full                            # LLM essays + CI/flag/perf + evaluator scoring
```

`--seams "<goal>"` is the single entry point for seam analysis: it runs the normal discovery, then runs the `/seam-finder` stage for `<goal>` and writes `specs/brownfield/seams-<goal>.md`. (`/seam-finder` remains directly invokable as a power-user stage, but you don't need to call it separately.)

Default `/brownfield` is intentionally lean and DeepWiki-first: build the deterministic graph/wiki, write **deterministic** short maps (no LLM essays), refresh nav indexes, and stop. Use `--full` for LLM-enriched essays, migration audits, CI/flag/perf inventory, or formal discovery scoring. Use `--for "<goal>"` to goal-scope the lean maps + optional seam ranking.

| `specs/brownfield/change-strategy.md` | **Lean:** lane table + context-first steps. **`--full`:** richer strategy |
| `specs/brownfield/ci-map.md`, `flag-inventory.md`, `perf-baseline.json` | `--full` only: CI alignment, feature flags, and latency baseline |
| `specs/brownfield/seams-<goal>.md` | Optional ranked seam candidates produced by `/seam-finder "<goal>"` |
| `specs/brownfield/naming-clusters.md` | Deterministic root-noun clusters from `code-graph.json` symbols — candidate domain terms for Step 6 |

## Step 1 — Inventory the Repo

Discover facts, not guesses:

- Languages and frameworks
- Package managers and lockfiles
- App entry points
- Test/build/lint/typecheck commands
- Runtime services and Docker/compose files
- Environment/config files
- CI workflows
- Database migrations or schema files
- Public API route definitions
- Frontend routes/screens

Use `rg`, `find`, package manifests, config files, and existing docs. Prefer primary repo evidence over assumptions.

---

## Step 1.5 — Build the Dependency Graph (delegate to `/code-map`)

Run the `/code-map` skill (`.claude/skills/code-map/SKILL.md`) — its Steps 1–3 are the **single source of truth** for producer detection (AST indexer → Understand-Anything import → regex fallback), the exact commands, and the rendering of `symbol-map.md`, `dependency-graph.md`, and `coupling-report.md`. Do not restate or improvise those commands here; if anything in this skill disagrees with code-map's SKILL.md, code-map wins.

Expected artifacts under `specs/brownfield/` when it completes: `code-graph.json` (+ `.meta.json`), `symbol-map.md`, `skeletons/` (god files only), `dependency-graph.md`, `coupling-report.md`, and `wiki/WIKI.md` + pages.

If the graph is empty or has only warnings, stop and report. Do not invent architecture from filenames. When the AST producer ran, treat `symbol-map.md` and `skeletons/` as the navigation layer: read a single symbol with `Read(offset=START, limit=END-START+1)` instead of reading god files whole.

### Step 1.6 — Deterministic lean maps + nav refresh (default)

Always run after a successful code-map (seconds, no LLM):

```bash
# Optional goal from --for "..." or the brownfield argument when it is a phrase
node .claude/scripts/nav-brownfield-maps.js --root . --goal "<goal-or-empty>"
node .claude/scripts/nav-query.js refresh
```

This writes/refreshes: lean `codebase-map.md`, `architecture-map.md`, `test-map.md`, `risk-map.md`, `change-strategy.md`, TF-IDF index, graph inverted index, co-change, concept pages.

**Lean mode stops after Step 1.6 + Step 6 (glossary) + Gate** — skip LLM Steps 2–5 unless `--full` or the user explicitly asked for narrative maps.

When a goal is present, also run:
```bash
node .claude/scripts/nav-query.js pack --diff --budget 1600 "<goal>"
```
and attach the pack summary to the human gate.

---

## Step 2 — Map Architecture (`--full` only for LLM narrative)

In **lean** mode, keep the deterministic `architecture-map.md` from Step 1.6. Do not regenerate with an LLM.

In **`--full`**, expand `architecture-map.md` as a short companion to the wiki:

- Major modules and their responsibilities — cite specific edges from `code-graph.json`
- Public interfaces for each major module — use the graph symbols list where available
- Data flow through the system — follow `imports` / `calls` chains
- External integrations — cite `ext:*` targets from the graph where available
- Persistence boundaries
- Auth/session boundaries
- Existing layering conventions — confirm with directional fan-in/fan-out from `coupling-report.md`
- Deep modules worth preserving — high fan-in and low instability
- Shallow/pass-through modules that may be refactor candidates — high instability and little domain logic

Every "module X depends on Y" claim must reference graph evidence, preferably an edge with file:line evidence. Do not redesign the system. Capture what exists.

---

## Step 3 — Map Tests (`--full` only for deep inventory)

In **lean** mode, keep the deterministic `test-map.md` from Step 1.6.

In **`--full`**, expand `test-map.md` with:

- Test frameworks and commands
- Unit/integration/e2e locations
- Which public interfaces are covered
- Which critical public interfaces lack tests
- Known slow/flaky tests if discoverable
- Whether tests isolate env/config correctly

If commands are obvious and safe, run lightweight discovery commands such as `npm test -- --help`, `pytest --collect-only`, or package script listing. Do not run expensive test suites unless the user asked.

---

## Step 3.5 — Optional Full Inventory (`--full` only)

Skip this section in default lean mode. In `--full`, run the deterministic CI and flag inventory scripts:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/ci-ingest.js --root .     # → specs/brownfield/ci-map.md
node .claude/scripts/flag-scan.js --root .     # → specs/brownfield/flag-inventory.md
```

If the app is runnable (manifest has `evaluation.api_base_url` and `evaluation.health_check`, and the stack is up), also capture the performance baseline:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/perf-baseline.js          # → specs/brownfield/perf-baseline.json
# after a change: node .claude/scripts/perf-baseline.js --compare   (exit 1 on p95 regression)
```

- `ci-map.md` extracts the test/lint/coverage commands the project's CI *actually* enforces, with an alignment section against the harness gates. Where CI and harness disagree (different linter, different coverage bar), surface the discrepancy in `change-strategy.md` — the stricter gate should win, and the choice belongs to the user.
- `flag-inventory.md` lists feature-flag usage (SDKs, `FEATURE_*` env gates, config flags) with references. Flags gate dark code paths: a change inside a flagged path needs the flag's production state known before the lane is chosen.

Both are heuristic extractions — spot-check anything load-bearing against the source files. If a script reports nothing (no CI config, no flags), note that in the relevant map; absence is itself a finding.

## Step 3.6 — Modularity Review (`--full` only, gap G6)

The deterministic `coupling-report.md` says *where* the coupling is; it cannot say whether a high-fan-in module is a god module or a legitimate factory, or whether two similar files are real duplication. Add the inferential layer, grounded in the coupling data so it does not flag intentional patterns:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/modularity-pack.js     # → specs/brownfield/modularity-pack.md (+ .json)
```

Then spawn the `modularity-reviewer` agent (artifact/maintainability sensor — inferential) against the pack. It judges semantic duplication, misplaced responsibility, argument clumps, and cycles against the source, confirms which `likely-legitimate` hubs are genuinely fine, and writes `specs/reviews/modularity-review.md` + `modularity-verdict.json`. This is a maintainability *sensor*, not a gate — it informs `change-strategy.md` and prioritizes refactoring; it never blocks. Skip in lean mode.

Once the agent completes, record that a real review just ran (gap G19 — the drift-cadence staleness proxy that tells the next drift run which unstable hubs are new since this review):

```bash
node .claude/scripts/record-modularity-review.js
```

This writes/updates `.claude/state/modularity-review-marker.json` with `{timestamp, unstableHubIds}` — the current unstable-hub set at the moment this review ran. Skip only if it errors for lack of a code-graph (already handled loudly by the script itself).

---

## Step 4 — Map Risks (`--full` only for deep narrative)

In **lean** mode, keep the deterministic `risk-map.md` from Step 1.6.

In **`--full`**, expand `risk-map.md` with:

### Domain risks

- Auth, permissions, privacy, billing, payment, and security-sensitive paths
- Database migrations and irreversible data operations
- External APIs and side-effecting integrations
- Generated code or vendored code that should not be edited manually
- Areas where tests are weak or missing
- Code paths gated by feature flags (`flag-inventory.md`) — the inactive branch may be the production one

### Structural risks

Read these from `coupling-report.md` and `code-graph.json`:

- **Cycles** — files inside strongly connected components; refactors across cycle boundaries need explicit approval.
- **Hub modules without tests** — high fan-in files without corresponding test coverage in `test-map.md`.
- **Unstable hubs** — fan_in >= 5 and instability >= 0.8.
- **Orphan files** — fan_in == 0 and not an entry point.

For each risk, include the evidence path or graph node id.

---

## Step 5 — Recommend Change Strategy (`--full` only for deep narrative)

In **lean** mode, keep the deterministic `change-strategy.md` from Step 1.6 (already includes context-first steps).

In **`--full`**, expand `change-strategy.md` with:

- What qualifies for `/vibe`
- What should use `/change` (behavior change; `--issue N` for a tracked bug)
- What should use `/refactor`
- What requires `/spec` → `/design` → `/auto`
- What should require explicit human approval before touching

Include a short "first safe next steps" list.

When recommending `/spec → /design → /auto` for any cluster of work, note in the strategy that `/auto` parallelizes on two axes:
- **Within a group:** multi-story groups (≥ 2 stories) fan out into parallel teammates — see `.claude/agents/generator.md` Rule 2.
- **Across groups:** independent dependency groups run concurrently as group-orchestrators (up to 3 by default) — see Section 4B of `.claude/skills/auto/SKILL.md`.

This shapes how you cluster stories AND how you shape the dependency graph: clusters with truly independent stories get within-group parallelism, and independent dependency groups (backend vs frontend vs ingest, for example) get cross-group parallelism. Prefer designs that surface independence at both levels — group by integration boundary internally, and minimize cross-group `Consumes:` edges in the dependency graph.

If the requested work has a concrete goal, run seam analysis via `/brownfield --seams "<goal>"` (which runs the `/seam-finder` stage for you). Use `seams-<goal>.md` to choose whether the next lane should extend an existing seam, wrap a boundary, introduce an adapter, split a read/write path, or avoid a poor seam.

---

## Step 6 — Domain Glossary

Run the deterministic naming-cluster extraction before writing anything:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/naming-clusters.js
```

This writes `specs/brownfield/naming-clusters.md` — root nouns that recur across 2+ symbols in `code-graph.json` (e.g. `Account` appearing in `AccountController`, `AccountRepository`, `AccountService`), each with file evidence. Treat this as candidate terms to confirm, not a final glossary — judge each against the source before writing a definition. It only catches suffix-stripped symbol names, not terms embedded purely in prose or comments, so also add any other recurring domain terms you find in the source.

Create or update `CONTEXT.md` from the confirmed candidates:

```markdown
# Context

## Terms

### Account
Definition meaningful to users/domain experts.

### User
Definition and how it differs from Account.
```

Do not fill `CONTEXT.md` with implementation details. Every codebase produces at least the naming-clusters evidence file, so create `CONTEXT.md` even if only 1-2 terms are confirmed — it is no longer purely optional.

---

## Gate

Before recommending implementation, present:

- What the system appears to be
- Highest-risk areas
- Existing test confidence
- Recommended lane for the requested work
- Any uncertainty that needs human confirmation

Do not proceed to code changes from `/brownfield` unless the user explicitly asks.

---

## Phase Evaluation Gate (`--full` only)

In lean mode, do not spawn an evaluator just to score discovery prose. The deterministic graph/wiki and source citations are the gate. In `--full`, after all discovery artifacts are written, spawn the `evaluator` agent (artifact mode) to validate the brownfield analysis.

**Agent invocation:**

Spawn Agent with subagent_type="evaluator" and prompt:
- Phase: brownfield
- Artifacts: specs/brownfield/codebase-map.md, specs/brownfield/architecture-map.md, specs/brownfield/test-map.md, specs/brownfield/risk-map.md, specs/brownfield/coupling-report.md, specs/brownfield/code-graph.json (if exists)
- Upstream: null (verify against actual codebase instead)
- Rubric: Read .claude/templates/phase-eval-rubrics.json, key "brownfield"
- Iteration: 1 (increment on retry)
- Previous score: null (or previous iteration's weighted_average)
- Verification: Spot-check 3-5 modules claimed in architecture-map.md actually exist as directories/files. Verify test commands in test-map.md reference real test files.
- Write result to specs/reviews/phase-brownfield-eval.json

**Ratchet loop (max 2 iterations):**

1. If verdict is **PASS** — proceed to Human Gate with eval summary.
2. If verdict is **FAIL** — re-scan the areas with findings. Update the maps. Re-run evaluator.
3. **Ratchet rule:** weighted_average must be >= previous iteration. Revert on regression.
4. After 2 iterations — present best version with findings to human.

---

## Human Gate

**Human approval is required before proceeding to implementation.**

Present the discovery maps with the quality summary:
- Wiki path: `specs/brownfield/wiki/WIKI.md`
- Any remaining warnings from the graph producer or, in `--full`, the evaluator
- Recommended change strategy

Ask: "Does this brownfield analysis look accurate? Approve to proceed, or flag areas that need re-scanning."

Do not proceed to code changes from `/brownfield` unless the user explicitly approves the discovery AND requests changes.

---

## Gotchas

- **Do not invent architecture.** If evidence is missing, say unknown.
- **Do not create parallel implementations.** Brownfield work modifies existing paths unless a story/design explicitly approves a replacement.
- **Do not trust names alone.** Confirm responsibilities from imports, tests, route wiring, and callers.
- **Do not over-map the universe.** Focus enough to guide safe future changes.
- **Do not run destructive commands.** Discovery is read-only except for writing brownfield docs and optional `CONTEXT.md`.
